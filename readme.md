To test it in your localhost create a directory --- codeline/film and paste wordpress files in it and also install the database in phpmyadmin or your mysql server,so your localhost URL would be like http://localhost/codeline/film , to access dashboard http://localhost/codeline/film/wp-admin/ <br/>
Username: admin  <br/>
Password: admin@123  <br/>
Iâ€™ve already created two movies for testing purpose, to test from your end add movies from your end too.
You can view the list of movies from URL: http://localhost/codeline/film/films/
Clicking on movie will take you to movie detail page which include movie details as per document like, release date, genre, country, and ticket price.
